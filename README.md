# Rocket Powered Pastebin (Enhanced) (`rktpb-extra` | [`paste.remnant.gay`])

A pastebin that does just enough to be _really_ useful.

  - [x] Really fast, really lightweight.
  - [x] Renders _markdown_ like GitHub.
  - [x] Renders [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) terminal screen recordings.
  - [x] Highlights `source code`.
  - [x] Returns plain text, too.
  - [x] Has a simple API usable via CLI.
  - [x] Has support for CORS.
  - [x] Limits paste upload sizes.
  - [x] No database: uses the file system.
  - [x] Automatically deletes stale pastes.

This pastebin powers [`paste.remnant.gay`], a public instance. Further usage details can
be found there.

## Usage

**R**oc**k**e**t** Powered **P**aste**b**in (`rktpb`) is written in
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs). To start the
server, use `cargo`:

```sh
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SergioBenitez/rktpb

# change into directory: the `static` folder needs to be in CWD before running
cd rktpb

# compile and start the server with the default config
cargo run
```

## Configuration

Configuration is provided via [environment variables](#environment-variables) or
a [TOML file](#toml-file). A set of defaults is always provided.

The complete list of configurable parameters is below:

|                       |                             |                                           |

| `socks5_example_addr` | `""`                        | an example proxy to pass to curl/pwsh     |

You'll definitely want to configure the values in the first two categories, from
`id_length` to `cors`.

You should likely use the defaults for the rest.

### Environment Variables

Use an environment variable name equivalent to the parameter name prefixed with
`PASTE_`:

```sh
PASTE_ID_LENGTH=10 PASTE_MAX_AGE="1 year" ./rktpb
```

To set structured data via environment variables, such as CORS, use [TOML-like
syntax](https://docs.rs/figment/latest/figment/providers/struct.Env.html):

```sh
PASTE_CORS='{"http://example.com"=["get", "post"]}' ./rktpb
```

### TOML File

See [`Paste.toml.template`](Paste.toml.template) for a template with all of the
defaults set as well as a dummy `cors` configuration for `http://example.com`
that allows the `options`, `get`, `post`, and `delete` HTTP methods.

```sh
mv Paste.toml.template Paste.toml
```

By default, the application searches for a file called `Paste.toml` in the CWD.
The path to the file can be overridden by setting `PASTE_CONFIG`. For example,
to use a file named `rktpb.toml`, use `PASTE_CONFIG="rktpb.toml" ./rktpb`.

## Deploying

To deploy, build in release mode and ship/run the resulting binary along with
`static/`, `templates/`, and any config:

```sh
# build in release mode for `${TARGET}`
cargo build --release --target ${TARGET}

# create a tarball of everything that's needed
tar -cvzf "rktpb.tar.gz" \
    Paste.toml static templates \
    -C target/${TARGET}/release rktpb
```

However you choose to deploy, you'll need to ensure that the CWD at the time the
server is started contains the `static` and `templates` directories as well as
the config file, if one is used.

Note that when the server is compiled in `release` mode, the `[release]` section
of a TOML config file can be used to override config values; the same is true
when compiled in `debug` mode with `[debug]`.
