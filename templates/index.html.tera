  ABOUT

      A simple pastebin powered by <a href="http://rocket.rs">Rocket</a>.

      Simple API. CLI. Web form. Renders Markdown. Highlights code.

      Web Form: <a href="{{ config.server_url }}/web" alt="web form">{{ config.server_url }}/web</a>

  API USAGE

      POST {{ config.server_url }}/

          Send the raw data along. Will respond with a link to the paste.

          If the response code is 201 (CREATED), then the entire paste was
          uploaded. If the response is 206 (PARTIAL), then the paste exceeded
          the server's maximum upload size, and only part of the paste was
          uploaded. If the response code is anything else, an error has
          occurred. Pasting is heavily rate limited.

      GET {{ config.server_url }}/&lt;id>

          Retrieve the paste with the given id as plain-text.

      GET {{ config.server_url }}/&lt;id>.&lt;ext>

          Retrieve the paste with the given id.

          If ext is "md", "mdown", or "markdown", the paste is rendered as
          markdown into HTML. If ext is "cast" it is rendered as an <a href="https://asciinema.org">asciinema</a> terminal recording.
          If ext is a known code file extension, the paste
          is syntax highlighted and returned as HTML. If ext is a known format
          extension, the paste is returned with the format's corresponding
          Content-Type. Otherwise, the paste is returned as unmodified text.

      DELETE {{ config.server_url }}/&lt;id>

          Delete the paste with the given id.

  EXAMPLES

      Paste a file named 'file.txt' using {{ cmd }}:

          {% if os == "windows" -%}
              Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "{{ config.server_url }}" -Method Post -InFile .\file.txt
          {%- else -%}
              curl --data-binary @file.txt {{ config.server_url }}/
          {%- endif %}

      Paste from stdin using {{ cmd }}:

          {% if os == "windows" -%}
              echo "Hi!" | Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "{{ config.server_url }}" -Method Post
          {%- else -%}
              echo "Hello, world." | curl --data-binary @- {{ config.server_url }}/
          {%- endif %}

      Delete an existing paste with id &lt;id> using {{ cmd }}:

          {% if os == "windows" -%}
              Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "{{ config.server_url }}/&lt;id>" -Method Delete
          {%- else -%}
              curl -X DELETE {{ config.server_url }}/&lt;id>
          {%- endif %}

      {% if os == "windows" -%}
         A {{ cmd }} function that can be used for quick pasting from the
      command line. The command takes a filename or reads from stdin if none was
      supplied and outputs the URL of the paste to stdout: `Paste file.txt` or
      `echo "hi" | Paste`.

          function Paste([string]$file) {
              $Data = if ($file) {Get-Content $file} else {$input}
              Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "{{ config.server_url }}" -Method Post -Body $Data
          }
      {%- else -%}
         A shell function that can be added to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profle` for
      quick pasting from the command line. The command takes a filename or reads
      from stdin if none was supplied and outputs the URL of the paste to
      stdout: `paste file.txt` or `echo "hi" | paste`.

          function paste() {
              local file=${1:-/dev/stdin}
              curl --data-binary @${file} {{ config.server_url }}
          }
      {%- endif %}
